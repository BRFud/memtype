Welcome to the MemType documentation, here you'll learn everything about the 
MemType hardware, firmware, software tools and usage for any user level.

If you fancy one, you can get it from our 
https://www.tindie.com/stores/area0x33/[tindie store]!


== Introduction

Technically speaking the MemType is an open source `hardware password keeper`.
This means it is basically a device focused in securely `storing passwords`.
The `open source` part means that we share all the
software source files, hardware design files and documentation under the
<<License>> conditions.

Having the passwords stored in a password keeper has several advantages:

* No reusing same pass in different apps or webs.
* More secure and long passwords can be used, no need to remember them.
* No more forgotten passwords.

We like hardware password keepers but we couldn't find one that satisfied our
usability needs, also they were very expensive! That's why we decided to make
the MemType `loaded with features` and with a `reduced BOM` that results in a 
simple `low cost` device that's also great for `DIY makers` and `hackers`.

=== MemType features

* `Encrypted storage` in the device using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOEKEON[NOEKEON] written
in pure assembler!
* `AES encrypted backups` on the PC using the <<MemTypeTool GUI>>.
* Plug it into a `USB`, `no drivers or software for using it`.footnote:[Using it doesn't require 
software or drivers. For managing operations like storing credentials or changing 
the PIN the MemTypeTool is needed and depending on the OS the libusb driver.]!
Works as a HID keyboard.
* `Works anywhere!`. While others only work on webs or certain 
apps, the MemType can be used anywhere from webs, apps, terminals or anywhere 
it's allowed to type using a keyboard.
* `One click login`. It stores and `types for you` not only the `password` but
also the `user` without any interaction from your part, and it also submits it!
* Add `delays` to `enter the password when it's asked`, for example in `ssh` or
login forms where the user and password are asked in two steps.
* `Dynamic storage`. You're `not limited` to a certain number of credentials, 
just fill the 2KB storage with them.
* `Assign names` to the credentials so you can find them easy and fast to use them.
* Manage the device with the <<MemTypeTool GUI>> software, super easy and simple!
* `Truly multiplatform`. The MemType works on `any device with usb` keyboard 
capability like tablets, smart tv, and phones.
* `Any keyboard layout`. Load the keyboard layout you've got working in your OS 
using the <<MemTypeTool GUI>>. 
* `Truly Open Source` Software and Hardware.

[qanda]
Can I make a MemType myself?::
	Yes! It's a great DIY project!. 
	You can make your PCB using the design files or order one from
	OSHpark, buy the components, solder them, compile the firmware and burn
	it into the microcontroller!

How many credentials can be stored?::
	The capacity of the credentials storage on the MemType is `2KB`.
	Credentials are stored dinammically so `it'll depend on the length` of the
	name, username, password etc...

Can I make a backup of my credentials?::
	Having a backup of the credentials is always a good idea. You can export
	an encrypted file from the `MemTypeGUI` containning all your
	credentials.
