********************

name (String)

A table for conversion will be needed when credentials can be created.

Description
***********

name: The name to identify the credential. For example "GmailUser"

line1: The first line of the credential for example "user@mail.com".
       Note that this can be used also with command line logins like:
       "ssh user@host.com" or "sftp user@host.com" with this trick 
       the device will type the command too :)

hop:  The key o keys needed to move focus from first line
      to second line. For example in gmail that is a tab "/t", in ssh
      it is an enter "/n" or in some other webs it can be several tabs
      "/t/t/t/t" or any other key combination. “o multiplicador”

line2: That is the password itself. For example "mysuperpass" or similar.


submit: That's the key or keys needed to submit the credential. For example
        in gmail that is tab and enter "/t/n" in ssh an enter "/n" or it 
        can be any other combination needed by your specific software.
